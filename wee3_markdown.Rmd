Then read in the GeoPackage layer for the whole of Australia (layer ending in 0)


```{r cars, echo=TRUE}
library(sf)
library(sp)
Ausoutline <- st_read(here("data", "gadm36_AUS.gpkg"), 
                      layer='gadm36_AUS_0')
print(Ausoutline)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
